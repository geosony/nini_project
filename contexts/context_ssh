# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# This Include directive is not part of the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH. Options set in the included configuration files generally override
# those that follow.  The defaults only apply to options that have not been
# explicitly set.  Options that appear multiple times keep the first value set,
# unless they are a multivalue option such as HostKey.
